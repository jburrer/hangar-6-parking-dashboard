# Hangar 6 Parking Dashboard

This is a simple React app to help dispatch keep track of aircraft locations.

It is built off of the create-react-app tutorial (https://create-react-app.dev/).
Also reference https://react.dev/.

I used the nix package manager and direnv are used to create a development environment.
